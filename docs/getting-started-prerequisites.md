# Installing prerequisites

```diff
- <b>IMPORTANT</b>: This repository is only compatible with macOS and Linux operating systemsâ€”Windows is not supported at this time.
```

If you are using Windows, please consider using a [DataRobot Codespace](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-notebook/codespaces/index.html) Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a virtual machine running a supported OS.

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed and on your system at the required version (or newer).
It is **recommended to install the tools system-wide** rather than in a virtual environment to ensure they are available in your terminal session.
Refer to the [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions) section for more details.
